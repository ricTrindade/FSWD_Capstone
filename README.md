# üé¨ Casting Agency

The **Casting Agency** models a company responsible for creating movies and managing/assigning actors to those movies. You are an **Executive Producer** working to streamline this process via a web-based system.

## üí° Motivation for the Project

The **Casting Agency** project was developed to demonstrate the implementation of a role-based access control system in a real-world scenario. It showcases how to securely manage resources (movies and actors) while ensuring that users with different roles (e.g., Casting Assistant, Casting Director, Executive Producer) have appropriate permissions. This project also highlights the integration of modern authentication and authorization techniques using Auth0, along with best practices for building scalable and secure APIs.
